Here are some SQL queries you can use to extract meaningful insights from the flattened Electric Vehicle (EV) data stored in Delta Tables.

Total Number of Electric Vehicles by Make

SELECT Make, COUNT(*) AS Total_Vehicles
FROM DimVehicle
GROUP BY Make
ORDER BY Total_Vehicles DESC;
Insight: Identifies the most popular EV brands.

Number of Electric Vehicles Registered Per Year

SELECT Model_Year, COUNT(*) AS Total_Vehicles
FROM DimVehicle
GROUP BY Model_Year
ORDER BY Model_Year DESC;
Insight: Shows EV adoption trends over time.

Top 10 Cities with the Highest EV Registrations

SELECT City, COUNT(*) AS EV_Count
FROM DimLocation
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY EV_Count DESC
LIMIT 10;
Insight: Determines the top cities with the highest EV adoption.

Most Common Electric Vehicle Type

SELECT ev_type, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM DimVehicle
GROUP BY ev_type
ORDER BY Count DESC;
Insight: Understands whether Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) or Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles (PHEV) are more prevalent.

Distribution of EVs by Legislative District

SELECT ldm.District_Name, COUNT(*) AS EV_Count
FROM DimLocation dl
JOIN LegislativeDistrictMapping ldm ON dl.Legislative_District_ID = ldm.Legislative_District_ID
GROUP BY ldm.District_Name
ORDER BY EV_Count DESC;
Insight: Helps policymakers see which districts have the most EVs.

Top 5 Counties with the Most EVs

SELECT County, COUNT(*) AS EV_Count
FROM DimLocation
GROUP BY County
ORDER BY EV_Count DESC
LIMIT 5;
Insight: Identifies counties leading in EV adoption.

Average Electric Range by Vehicle Make

SELECT Make, AVG(Electric_Range) AS Avg_Range
FROM FactVehicleRegistration
GROUP BY Make
ORDER BY Avg_Range DESC;
Insight: Compares the efficiency of different EV brands.

Most Common Census Tract for EV Owners

SELECT Census_Tract_ID, COUNT(*) AS EV_Count
FROM DimLocation
GROUP BY Census_Tract_ID
ORDER BY EV_Count DESC
LIMIT 10;
Insight: Helps urban planners analyze EV adoption per census tract.

Most Expensive EV Models Based on MSRP

SELECT Make, Model, MAX(Base_MSRP) AS Max_MSRP
FROM FactVehicleRegistration
GROUP BY Make, Model
ORDER BY Max_MSRP DESC
LIMIT 10;
Insight: Identifies premium EV models in the dataset.

EV Adoption Trends Over the Years

SELECT Model_Year, COUNT(*) AS EV_Count
FROM DimVehicle
GROUP BY Model_Year
ORDER BY Model_Year DESC;
Insight: Helps track how EV adoption has grown year over year.
